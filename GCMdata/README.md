Future climate data were obtained from the CMIP6 suite of generalize circulation models (GCMs), downscaled and bias-corrected by the Inter-Sectoral Model Intercomparison Project (ISI-MIP). 

Variables included precipitation (mm), average air temperature (K), relative humidity (%), wind speed (m/s), and incoming shortwave radiation (W/m^2)..

Data were obtained for each day from January 2001 through December 2100 and aggregated to form minimum, average, and maximum monthly values within the `fourstates.R` code. An exception is the radiation data, which were only aggregated to monthly averages.

Data were collected for each contiguous US state and Washington DC. For state ID codes, see `CONUS_States_info.xslx` in this folder.
